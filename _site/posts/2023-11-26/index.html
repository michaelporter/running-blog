<h1>First Four Weeks</h1>

<p>I'm four weeks into training now for the <a href="https://napavalleymarathon.org/" target="_blank">Napa Valley Marathon</a>, my first; selected due to its net-negative elevation, and <a href="https://findmymarathon.com/weather-detail.php?zname=Napa%20Valley%20Marathon&year=" target="_blank">near-guarantee of cool weather</a>, important after witnessing the 2022 NYC Marathon. I intended to start writing about it four weeks ago, but now's as good a milestone as any. And besides, looking back now at the naive fool I was four weeks ago - what could he have to say about anything?</p>
<p>Eh, too harsh.</p>
<p>But, coming off my longest run yet — 15.15 miles — I'm struck by how unstruck I am by it. This is the longest I've run in a single outing in my life. Had I considered this a few months ago, I would have been so impressed. But now, today, I know that last week I ran 14 miles — my highest mileage at the time — and next week I'll run 16. And I know I can do it.</p>
<p>That's likely where this feeling is coming from. I know now that I can do it. I know I can do 16, and if I do 16 then I can squeeze out 17. Then 18 is only 1 away. Two more and I hit 20.</p>
<p>Twenty. That's where my perspective is now anchored. Twenty is the number that feels impossible, but lingering just over my shoulder is the adage I've been reading for months now — during the marathon, 20 is only half-way. After 20 is when the real race starts. After 20, you are on your own.</p>
<p>Mile 21 for me right now is as elusive as whatever it is that lies over the Flat Earther's ice wall. Could be anything. Or nothing.</p>
<p>My first 20 miler is set for Christmas Eve.</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>- 34 Miles</p>
<p>- 38 Miles</p>
<p>- 40 Miles</p>
<p>- 45 Miles</p>
<p>These are the first four weeks of my 18-week plan, and they build on the base I created during the 12-week plan that took me to the Chicago Half this summer.</p>
<p>I'm following Pfitzinger's 18/55 plan — 18 weeks, peaking at 55 miles. It's broken up into 4 blocks with distinct focus:</p>
<p><strong>Block 1:</strong> Endurance. 6 Weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Block 2:</strong> Lactate Threshold + Endurance. 5 Weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Block 3:</strong> Race Preparation. 4 Weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Block 4:</strong> Taper and Race. 3 Weeks.</p>
<p>Pfitz's book says I'm ready for this, but two things point otherwise:</p>
<p>1. Internet people think you need to be doing much higher mileage before starting. At least 50mpw.</p>
<p>2. Pfitz's book itself is targeted at marathoners capable of 3:00 - 3:30 finish times.</p>
<p>I have no clue what my finish time can feasibly be. A beginner's math says to double my best Half and add 20 minutes, which gets me to 4:06. Pfitz's pace chart <strong><em>ends</em></strong> at 4:00, but I'm also rapidly making Early Gains<sup>TM</sup>, so I think it's going to work out.</p>
<p>May try to understand Jack Daniels' formula when I start having a better idea of where my heart rate will land in Block 3.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my goal is: <strong>finish and still want to run NYC in the Fall.</strong></p>
<p>Secondary and tertiary goals will come with time.</p>
