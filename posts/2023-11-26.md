        I'm four weeks into training now for the <a href="https://napavalleymarathon.org/" target="_blank">Napa Valley Marathon</a>, my first; selected due to its net-negative elevation, and <a href="https://findmymarathon.com/weather-detail.php?zname=Napa%20Valley%20Marathon&year=" target="_blank">near-guarantee of cool weather</a>, important after witnessing the 2022 NYC Marathon. I intended to start writing about it four weeks ago, but now's as good a milestone as any. And besides, looking back now at the naive fool I was four weeks ago - what could he have to say about anything?

        Eh, too harsh.

        But, coming off my longest run yet &mdash; 15.15 miles &mdash; I'm struck by how unstruck I am by it. This is the longest I've run in a single outing in my life. Had I considered this a few months ago, I would have been so impressed. But now, today, I know that last week I ran 14 miles &mdash; my highest mileage at the time &mdash; and next week I'll run 16. And I know I can do it.

        That's likely where this feeling is coming from. I know now that I can do it. I know I can do 16, and if I do 16 then I can squeeze out 17. Then 18 is only 1 away. Two more and I hit 20.

        Twenty. That's where my perspective is now anchored. Twenty is the number that feels impossible, but lingering just over my shoulder is the adage I've been reading for months now &mdash; during the marathon, 20 is only half-way. After 20 is when the real race starts. After 20, you are on your own.

        Mile 21 for me right now is as elusive as whatever it is that lies over the Flat Earther's ice wall. Could be anything. Or nothing.

        My first 20 miler is set for Christmas Eve.

        - 34 Miles
        
        - 38 Miles
        
        - 40 Miles
        
        - 45 Miles

        These are the first four weeks of my 18-week plan, and they build on the base I created during the 12-week plan that took me to the Chicago Half this summer.

        I'm following Pfitzinger's 18/55 plan &mdash; 18 weeks, peaking at 55 miles. It's broken up into 4 blocks with distinct focus:

        **Block 1:** Endurance. 6 Weeks.

        **Block 2:** Lactate Threshold + Endurance. 5 Weeks.

        **Block 3:** Race Preparation. 4 Weeks.

        **Block 4:** Taper and Race. 3 Weeks.

        Pfitz's book says I'm ready for this, but two things point otherwise:

        1. Internet people think you need to be doing much higher mileage before starting. At least 50mpw.

        2. Pfitz's book itself is targeted at marathoners capable of 3:00 - 3:30 finish times.

        I have no clue what my finish time can feasibly be. A beginner's math says to double my best Half and add 20 minutes, which gets me to 4:06. Pfitz's pace chart **_ends_** at 4:00, but I'm also rapidly making Early Gains<sup>TM</sup>, so I think it's going to work out.

        May try to understand Jack Daniels' formula when I start having a better idea of where my heart rate will land in Block 3.

        Ultimately, my goal is: **finish and still want to run NYC in the Fall.**

        Secondary and tertiary goals will come with time.
